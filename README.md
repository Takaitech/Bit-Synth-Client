Bit Synth is an in browser polyphonic synthesizer and step sequencer that invites the user to shape sound and create synth presets to contribute to a public library of synth presets inspired by retro 8 bit and 16bit videogames. The step sequencer is 
where the user can experiment with melodies and test out their presets. The keyboard is available to desktop users and can be played right on the users computer keyboard.
